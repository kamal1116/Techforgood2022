<p>This is a basic student performance analysis with predefined data using basics of machine learning. We used a predetermined dataset consisting of students marksheets. The output analysis is visualized using graphs for each subject and its chapters. It is done using K-Clustering algorithom which is an unsupervised learning algorithm. Here a subject mark's labels are grouped into one single cluster.</p>
